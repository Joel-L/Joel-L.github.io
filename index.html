    <h2>Kriya Yoga</h2>
    <p>Many people have read Paramahamsa Yogananda's <em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em> and therefore heard of Kriya Yoga and its associated lineage. I was one of those people, and began to do some research into the method and its founders. Through this search, I met Narayana Baba, who eventually led me to Gurudev.</p>
