    <h2>Kriya Yoga</h2>
    <p>Many people have read Paramahamsa Yogananda's <em>Autobiography of a Yogi</em> and therefore heard of Kriya Yoga and its associated lineage. I was one of those people, and began to do some research into the method and its founders. Through this search, I met Narayana Baba, who eventually led me to Gurudev.</p>

  <section>
    <p> Narayana Baba's website is <a href="http://www.narayanababa.com"> here </a>.</p>
    <p><em>For Solo challenge 2.5, I am reviewing Narayana's website</em>
      <ul>
        <li><STRONG>PRO:</STRONG> I like how each section is clearly commented in. It makes it easy to see how the designer put things together, and you can see how that might be useful in updates. There is a lot of spacing in the code as well, which I like for similar reasons.</li>
        <li><strong>CON:</strong>I'm on the fence about how many meta tags there are. I understand it, but for whatever reason I chafe at that. The big complaint I have is, for how organized the rest of the code is, the <code>li</code> elements are not clearly segregated. If this is best practice, I don't like it because it isn't very readable.</li> 
      </ul>
